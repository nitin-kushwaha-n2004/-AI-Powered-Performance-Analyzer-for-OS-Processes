The AI-Powered Performance Analyzer for OS Processes is a web-based tool designed for real-time monitoring, intelligent analysis, and optimization of system processes. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a modern, responsive dashboard providing users with critical performance insights. Key features include real-time process monitoring, AI-driven bottleneck detection and resource usage prediction using rule-based logic, and actionable optimization suggestions.

The analyzer is modular, comprising a User Interface for visualization and interaction, Frontend Logic for data handling, an AI Analytics module for identifying anomalies and forecasting, a Styling module for a futuristic dark theme, and a Performance Optimization module ensuring smooth operation. Functionalities include live updates of CPU, memory, and I/O data, visual highlighting of resource bottlenecks, tailored optimization recommendations, resource forecasting via charts, and support for analyzing uploaded process data.

Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js for visualizations, and native JavaScript for data manipulation. The project aims to provide an effective solution for proactive system performance management, with future scope including system API integration, advanced AI implementation, a mobile app version, and automated optimization actions.
